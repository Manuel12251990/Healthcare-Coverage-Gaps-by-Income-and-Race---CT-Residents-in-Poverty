--CTEs, Case Statements, window functions, joins) that simulates how I arrived at the final version 

-- Step 1: Create raw synthetic base table 
SELECT *

BULK '\HealthCare Access CT Analysis\Dataset\ACS Data Tables\Relevant Files\Synthetic_Health_Equity_CT_2013_2023.csv',

FIRSTROW = 2
) AS data;

-- Step 2: Clean and standardize age buckets
WITH Cleaned AS (
SELECT *,
CASE 
WHEN [Age Group] = '0-4' THEN 'Under 5'
WHEN [Age Group] = '5-17' THEN '5-17'

WHEN [Age Group] = '35-64' THEN '35-64'
ELSE '65+'
END AS Age_Bucket

-- Step 3: Add poverty flag and uninsured poverty flag
PovertyFlags AS (
SELECT *,
CASE WHEN [Poverty Status] = 'Below Poverty' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS Poverty_Flag,
CASE 
WHEN [Poverty Status] = 'Below Poverty' AND [Insurance Status] = 'Uninsured' THEN 1 
ELSE 0 
END AS Poverty_Uninsured_Flag
FROM Cleaned

-- Step 4: Aggregate totals per Race + Year using window functions
Aggregated AS (
SELECT *,
SUM(Poverty_Flag) OVER (PARTITION BY Year, Race) AS Total_Poverty_By_Race_Year,
SUM(Poverty_Uninsured_Flag) OVER (PARTITION BY Year, Race) AS Uninsured_Poverty_By_Race_Year
FROM PovertyFlags
)

-- Step 5: Final Select with computed uninsured rate and geography included
SELECT 
*,
ROUND(
CAST(Uninsured_Poverty_By_Race_Year AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(Total_Poverty_By_Race_Year, 0) * 100, 
2
) AS Uninsured_Rate_Pct
INTO dbo.Health_Equity_CT_Final
